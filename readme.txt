Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.2.1


== Description ==

Piryx has become the leading donation platform for cause-based organizations in United States. Whether you are a nonprofit or a political organization, you're most likely using Piryx to help fund your organization.We love Piryx and we know you do too... but don't you wish you could keep donors on your own website without sending them off your own url?  Wouldn't it be cool if you could embed a Piryx donation form into any post or page?Now you can. We've created a simple plugin that gives you the ability to put a Piryx fundraising form on any page or post, which lets visitors donate money to Piryx-powered campaigns.The only costs associated with using Piryx for WordPress is a 1.0% transaction fee on money that you raise through the plugin and Piryx Fundraising. Piryx Fundraising charges an additional fee for the use of their payment processing technology, which includes merchant, credit card (Visa, MC, AMEX, Discover) and eCheck processing fees.  More information is available on their FAQ page at www.piryx.com.You must have a Piryx account to use this program.This plugin will not work on an unsecure server. You must have an SSL certificate installed correctly on your domain.


== Installation ==

1. Create a pixy account if you don't already have one [http://www.piyryx.com/](http://www.piryx.com)
2. Make sure you have an SSL certificate installed correctly on your url.
3. Install the plugin.
4. In admin backend, go to Settings > Piryx.
5. Click the "Login with Piryx" button to link the WordPress site with your Piryx account.
6. When editing posts/pages, you will see a new image in the Media Insert group, Add Piryx Form. Click this to insert a form on the post/page. 
7. You can also insert your own shortcode for the plugin, using [piryx id="yourcampaigncode" redirect_uri="yourredirectpage"]

That's it - the Piryx form will be shown on the page/post you inserted it on, and visitors will be able to donate to your campaign.

There are no monthly fees, no startup fees, no contracts, and no initial costs.
